# SIMBT_02
TASK #02

Develop a basic to-do web app that enables users to add daily tasks.

Allow users to add new items to a list, which must be visible.

Provide an option for users to mark a task as "complete" upon successful completion, and these completed tasks should appear on a separate "Completed Tasks" list.

Include a separate section titled "Pending Tasks" that lists all the tasks that require completion.

The to-do list should be a union of the "Pending Tasks" and "Completed Tasks" lists.

Allow users to delete or edit tasks from either list.

For added complexity, include the date and time when a task is added and/or completed.
